### About

This is my personal portfolio and blog website. I have moved from framework to framework... language to language for this site over the years. I have forced myself to settle with Go, it is the most overall proficient language; I will touch more on my Go decision below. this site is meant to show off a range of skills in all things http and allow me to write my thoughts and opinions down somewhere. I am not excepting anyone to read anything here but if you do I hope you enjoy my insanity.

### Why Go

Well Go is an interesting language; it's honestly kind of a boring language. Nothing flashy, nothing super special. But what Go does well is get your projects to a state of excellence very quickly and easily. I know some people like to get crazy and go for that top 1% of performance in all that they do... thats me... but I have had to break that within me. Go is no settling, Go is maturing and realizing simplicy in coding is your best friend not an enemy. Go also has a great net/http package that is a lot of fun to work with. It is low level enough to force you to dive deep and learn something, but high enough that your not going to spend six hours writing a http handler.

#### Some pros to Go

- fast compilation times
- easier syntax
- easy to read
- scalable
- great stdlib
- great tooling
- backed by a large community and well funded
- http is treated as first class

#### Negatives to Go

- boring syntax
- can become verbose
  - can be a pro, more transparency to what a function is doing
- explicate error handling is repetitve
- doesn't use type.(method) syntax; uses method(type) syntax
  - this is subjective, but not my favorite syntax
- Uppercase syntax for public package exporting instead of a 'pub' keyword
